Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion follows Newton's laws and is governed by kinematic equations. The motion can be broken down into: \u2705 Horizontal Motion: Constant velocity motion since there are no horizontal forces (ignoring air resistance). \u2705 Vertical Motion: Accelerated motion under gravity. We consider an object launched from ground level with an initial velocity at an angle from the horizontal. \ud83d\udd39 Equations of Motion The initial velocity components are: Using the kinematic equations: where: is gravitational acceleration ( m/s\u00b2 on Earth). is time.
