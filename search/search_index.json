By analyzing how the range of a projectile varies with its launch angle, we uncover fascinating relationships governed by linear and quadratic equations. These equations have broad applications, from sports (e.g., the trajectory of a soccer ball) to engineering (e.g., missile launch dynamics). \u2696 1. Theoretical Foundation \ud83d\udcdc Equations of Motion A projectile launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) follows a parabolic trajectory under the influence of gravity. We derive its motion using Newton's laws. \ud83d\udd39 Horizontal Motion Since there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction (assuming no air resistance), the velocity remains constant: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] \ud83d\udd39 Vertical Motion The vertical motion is governed by constant acceleration due to gravity \\( g \\) : \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] The projectile reaches the ground when \\( y = 0 \\) , solving for \\( t \\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] This is the total time of flight . \ud83d\udccf 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance covered by the projectile when it lands: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\( 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta \\) , we get: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin 2\\theta \\] \ud83d\udccc Key Observations: Maximum Range: The range is maximized when \\( \\sin 2\\theta = 1 \\) , i.e., \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) \u2192 \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . Symmetry: The function \\( R(\\theta) \\) is symmetric around \\( 45^\\circ \\) , meaning \\( R(\\theta) = R(90^\\circ - \\theta) \\) . Effect of Initial Velocity: Since \\( R \\propto v_0^2 \\) , doubling \\( v_0 \\) quadruples the range. Effect of Gravity: Since \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{g} \\) , projectiles travel farther on planets with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon). \ud83c\udf0e 3.
