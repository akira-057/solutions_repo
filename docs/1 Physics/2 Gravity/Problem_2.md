## ‚ùì Why Cosmic Velocities Matter

### üîπ What is it?

This concluding section shows the **practical value** of the entire work.

### üîπ Why is it needed?

- Connects **formulas and calculations with real-life applications**.
- Shows where they are used:
  - First cosmic velocity ‚Äî for satellites and orbits.
  - Second cosmic velocity ‚Äî for missions to the Moon and Mars.
  - Third cosmic velocity ‚Äî for missions beyond the solar system (e.g., Voyager).

### üîπ Benefits for the project

- Helps **understand the meaning behind the calculations**.
- Makes the report **complete and logical**.
- Creates a **better impression during the defense**.

### üîπ How to simplify it

> These velocities are important for space exploration because they help us understand the speeds required to launch satellites, send rockets to other planets, or even beyond the solar system.

‚úÖ These sections make your work not just "formula-based" but **meaningful and engaging**.


# üöÄ Cosmic Velocities and Escape Velocities

## üìò What Are Cosmic Velocities?

Cosmic velocities are speeds needed to move around or escape a celestial body:

- **First Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÅ)**: To orbit the body in a circle (like satellites).
- **Second Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÇ)**: To escape its gravity (like flying to space).
- **Third Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÉ)**: To leave the Solar System.

## üß† Derivations

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Cosmic Velocity \( v_1 \)

**Meaning**: Minimum speed to orbit just above the surface.

#### Derivation:

- Centripetal force:

  $$
  F = \frac{m \cdot v^2}{r}
  $$

- Gravitational force:

  $$
  F = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2}
  $$

Equating:

$$
\frac{m \cdot v^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot M \cdot m}{r^2}
$$

Cancelling \( m \) and solving:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}}
$$

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Cosmic Velocity \( v_2 \)

**Meaning**: Minimum speed to escape a planet's gravity.

#### Derivation:

From energy conservation:

$$
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{G M m}{r} = 0
$$

Solving:

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1
$$

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third Cosmic Velocity \( v_3 \)

**Meaning**: Speed to escape the Sun starting from Earth‚Äôs orbit.

#### Formula:

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M_{sun}}{r_{orbit}}}
$$

## üåç Earth: Example Values

- \( G = 6.674 \cdot 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg s}^2 \)  
- \( M = 5.972 \cdot 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)  
- \( r = 6.371 \cdot 10^6 \, \text{m} \)  
- \( M_{sun} = 1.989 \cdot 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)  
- \( r_{earth\ orbit} = 1.496 \cdot 10^{11} \, \text{m} \)

### Calculated:

- \( v_1 \approx 7.9 \, \text{km/s} \)
- \( v_2 \approx 11.2 \, \text{km/s} \)
- \( v_3 \approx 42.1 \, \text{km/s} \)
