# Problem 2

# ℹ️ Why the "Motivation" and "Why Cosmic Velocities Matter" Sections are Important

## 📘 Motivation

### 🔹 What is it?

This section explains **why the topic is important**, why it matters, and where it is applied.

### 🔹 Why is it needed?

- Helps the reader **get into the topic**.
- Explains **why cosmic velocities are important to study**.
- Makes the project more **meaningful and complete**.
- Answers the question:  
  > "Why should I care about this?"

### 🔹 Alternative

If you want, you can replace it with a short introduction like:

> This work discusses the speeds needed to reach orbit, escape a planet's gravity, and leave the solar system.

## ❓ Why Cosmic Velocities Matter

### 🔹 What is it?

This concluding section shows the **practical value** of the entire work.

### 🔹 Why is it needed?

- Connects **formulas and calculations with real-life applications**.
- Shows where they are used:
  - First cosmic velocity — for satellites and orbits.
  - Second cosmic velocity — for missions to the Moon and Mars.
  - Third cosmic velocity — for missions beyond the solar system (e.g., Voyager).

### 🔹 Benefits for the project

- Helps **understand the meaning behind the calculations**.
- Makes the report **complete and logical**.
- Creates a **better impression during the defense**.

### 🔹 How to simplify it

> These velocities are important for space exploration because they help us understand the speeds required to launch satellites, send rockets to other planets, or even beyond the solar system.

✅ These sections make your work not just "formula-based" but **meaningful and engaging**.
