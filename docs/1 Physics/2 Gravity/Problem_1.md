GRAVITY PROBLEM 1: A COSMIC INVESTIGATION

1. DERIVING KEPLER’S THIRD LAW

We begin by equating two fundamental forces:

Gravitational Force:
    F = GMm / r²

Centripetal Force:
    F = mv² / r

Setting them equal:
    mv² / r = GMm / r²
This simplifies to:
    v² = GM / r

Now use the formula for the orbital period:
    T = 2πr / v
Squaring both sides:
    T² = (4π²r²) / v²

Substitute v²:
    T² = 4π²r³ / GM

Therefore, Kepler's Third Law is:
    T² = (4π² / GM) * a³


2. VERIFICATION OF KEPLER’S LAW USING PLANETARY DATA

Using data for the inner planets:

Planet     | T (years) | a (AU)  | T²       | a³
-----------|-----------|---------|----------|---------
Mercury    | 0.2408    | 0.387   | 0.058    | 0.058
Venus      | 0.6152    | 0.723   | 0.378    | 0.378
Earth      | 1.000     | 1.000   | 1.000    | 1.000
Mars       | 1.8808    | 1.524   | 3.537    | 3.539

When T² is plotted against a³, the result is a straight line.
This confirms that:

    T² ∝ a³


3. CALCULATING THE MASS OF THE SUN

We use Earth’s orbit:

a = 1.496 × 10¹¹ m
T = 365.25 days = 3.156 × 10⁷ seconds
G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg/s²

Using:
    M = (4π²a³) / (G T²)

We find:
    M ≈ 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg

This matches the actual mass of the Sun.


4. CALCULATING THE MASS OF THE EARTH

Using the Moon’s orbit:

a = 3.84 × 10⁸ m
T = 27.32 days = 2.36 × 10⁶ seconds

Using the same formula:
    M = (4π²a³) / (G T²)

We find:
    M ≈ 6.01 × 10²⁴ kg

This also matches the known mass of the Earth.


CONCLUSION

Kepler’s 3rd Law accurately describes the motion of celestial bodies.
Using simple orbital data, we were able to estimate the masses of both the Sun and the Earth with excellent accuracy.

This shows the power of physics in understanding the universe.
