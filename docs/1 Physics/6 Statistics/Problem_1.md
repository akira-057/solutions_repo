# üß™ Central Limit Theorem (CLT) ‚Äì Simulation and Explanation

## üß† What is the Central Limit Theorem?

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states:

> If we take many random samples from any population, the means of those samples will form a **normal distribution** as the sample size increases.

---

## üìö Key Definitions

### 1. **Population**
The full set of data we want to study.

### 2. **Sample**
A smaller part taken from the population.

### 3. **Sample Mean**

If the sample values are:

$$
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n
$$

Then the sample mean is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}
$$

### 4. **Sampling Distribution**
The distribution of sample means from many random samples.

### 5. **Normal Distribution**
The classic "bell curve" that is symmetric around the mean.

## üîç Goal of the Simulation

- Show how sample means become normally distributed.
- Use different population types: `Uniform`, `Exponential`, `Binomial`.
- Explore how **sample size** affects the shape of the sampling distribution.

---

##  Simulation Steps

1. Create three population types (10,000 values each):
   - **Uniform**: all values are equally likely.
   - **Exponential**: many small values, few large ones.
   - **Binomial**: success/failure (0 or 1 outcomes).

2. Take random samples of sizes:
   - $$n = 5, 10, 30, 50$$
   - Repeat 1,000 times, calculate the mean each time.

3. Plot histograms of the sample means.

---

## üìä Expected Results (Graph Interpretation)

- For **small sample sizes** (e.g., **5**), the shape of the sampling distribution is **irregular** and often reflects the shape of the original population.
- As the **sample size increases** (e.g., **30 or 50**), the distribution of the sample means becomes **more bell-shaped**, closely resembling a **normal distribution**.
- This behavior occurs **regardless of the shape of the original population distribution** (uniform, exponential, binomial, etc.).
